    <strong>What is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)?</strong>

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative,
    hypermedia information systems that allows users to communicate data on the World Wide Web.

    <strong>What is the purpose of HTTP?</strong>

    HTTP was invented alongside HTML to create the first interactive, text-based web browser:
    the original World Wide Web. Today, the protocol remains one of the primary means of using the Internet.

    <strong>How does HTTP work?</strong>

    As a request-response protocol, HTTP gives users a way to interact with web resources such as
    HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers. HTTP clients
    generally use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections to communicate with servers.

    HTTP utilizes specific request methods in order to perform various tasks. All HTTP servers
    use the GET and HEAD methods, but not all support the rest of these request methods:

    GET requests a specific resource in its entirety
    HEAD requests a specific resource without the body content
    POST adds content, messages, or data to a new page under an existing web resource
    PUT directly modifies an existing web resource or creates a new URI if need be
    DELETE gets rid of a specified resource
    TRACE shows users any changes or additions made to a web resource
    OPTIONS shows users which HTTP methods are available for a specific URL
    CONNECT converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
    PATCH partially modifies a web resource

    <strong>Security Concerns Around HTTP</strong>

    Unfortunately, adversaries can choose from many vectors to attack web servers,
    web applications, and websites. From cross-site scripting (XSS) to HTTP request smuggling,
    adversaries typically exploit well-known vulnerabilities and misconfigurationsâ€”not to
    mention the HTTP security concerns around sending plaintext credentials via HTTP.
    The OWASP foundation has highlighted the top 10 security risks to avoid when building
    web applications, helping improve defenses against HTTP-based attacks.

    Adversaries also take advantage of HTTP to blend in with normal traffic while sneaking
    exfiltrated data and command-and-control communications past perimeter defenses.
    All these attacks also occur over HTTPS, an encrypted HTTP connection established with
    SSL/TLS. Learn how monitoring encrypted traffic matters for HTTP-based attacks such as
    the ProxyLogon Exchange Server exploit.
